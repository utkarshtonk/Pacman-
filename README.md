A modern recreation of the classic Pac-Man game, built to showcase dynamic gameplay, AI-driven ghost behavior, and clean, modular code design. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of 2D game development concepts and object-oriented programming principles.

Features:
Dynamic Maze: A fully functional maze where Pac-Man navigates to collect points.
Player Controls: Smooth and responsive movement for the player.
Ghost AI: Intelligent ghost behavior using pathfinding algorithms, making the game challenging and engaging.
Scoring System: Tracks and displays the player's progress.
Modular Design: Clean, maintainable code that allows easy customization and feature expansion.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python (or specify another language if used).
Graphics Library: Pygame (or specify the library/tool used for visuals).
Algorithms: Pathfinding for ghost AI (e.g., A* or similar).
